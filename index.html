<p style="color:lightskyblue">My name is Aidan Fire.</p>

<p>I grew up right here in Grand Forks, North Dakota.</p>

<p style="font-size:75%">I am currently planning to major in Communication Science and Disorders (CSD).</p>

<p>I have always been interested in computers. I have taken classes in cybersecurity and networking in high school, and am looking forward to what we will learn in this class. I have no previous experience with coding other than some very basic concepts that were covered in an introductory cybersecurity course, and those were in Linux. I can't wait to see what is in store for us this semester.</p>
