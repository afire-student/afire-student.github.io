<p style="color:lightgoldenrodyellow">One of my main hobbies is fishing. I have been fishing for as long as I can remember, and have fished at more places than I can remember. I was fortunate enough to have a 
dad patient enough to guide and teach me the art of fishing. It must have been painful, as I was a slow learner. In fact, the first thing I learned to do was snag the line.
I have a knack for it, if I do say so myself.</p>
