<h1 style="font-size:175%">My Academic Plan for the Spring Semester of 2021</h1>
<br>

<body>
<p style="color:lightcyan">I am majoring in Communication Science and Disorders. This major is more commonly known as speech-language pathology. I chose this major as it is a pre-requisite for audiology, which is my current end goal. I have been interested in audiology for as long as I can remember. My father owns and operates his own private practice in audiology, so I have always had a connection. Unfortunately, UND does not have an audiology program so I will have to attend another college in order to complete that goal.</p>

<p>This semester I am taking 16 credit hours of classes, which are:
<ul style="color:ghostwhite">
<li>CHEM 115: Introductory Chemistry</li>
<li>CHEM 115L: Introductory Chemistry Lab</li>
<li>CSCI 110: Introduction to Computer Science</li>
<li>ENGL 130: Composition II: Writing for Public Audiences</li>
<li>MUSC 100: Introduction to the Understanding of Music</li>
<li>CSD 340: Normal Language Structure</li>
