Normal Language Structure is a sophomore/junior level course required for aspiring speech-language pathologists and 
audiologists. It is a specialized course concerned with the identification and description of aspects of the rules that
govern mainstream American English. By gaining knowledge about the "proper" American English grammar, SLP's can properly
identify disorders of language and grammar. Normal language structure is provided by Professor Amebu Seddoh and is typically
offered at Columbia Hall.

While I am not aiming to be a speech-language pathologist, I am learning to become an audiologist. Audiology is an even-more
specialized branch of medical careers that deals with the identifcation and diagnosing of hearing and balance disorders.
By creating a base of knowledge to build off of, I will be able to reach this goal and excel in the field. I am
aiming for this field both because of my interest in helping people, and the ever-present demand for audiologists.
